This workshop is one component of our NSF POSE project to explore the creation of an open source ecosystem encompassing a variety of workflow technologies, including the Parsl Project (Kyle Chard at the University of Chicago), the RADICAL tools (Shantenu Jha, Rutgers University), and TaskVine (Douglas Thain, University of Notre Dame).

Workshop attendees conducted several working groups where they identified key barriers to workflow creation, deployment, and adoption; proposed activities for an open source ecosystem to support these needs; and provided feedback on the possible structure sof an ecosystem.

The organizers will be following up soon with a workshop report and draft proposal for next steps.

Thank you to everyone who participated!
