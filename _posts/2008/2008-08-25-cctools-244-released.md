We are pleased to announce release 2.4.4 of the Cooperative Computing Tools, including Parrot, Chirp, and other tools which may be downloaded here:

<p>A recent version of the patched Red Hat kernel installed by up2date inhibits access to the special file /proc/X/mem, which caused previous versions of Parrot to stop functioning with the error "Permission denied."<br/></p>

<p>This release works around that bug in the kernel.<br/><br/></p>
