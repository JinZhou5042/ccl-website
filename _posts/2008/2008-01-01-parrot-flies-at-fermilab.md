and the GROW filesystem are in production use at Fermi National Laboratory.  The CDF experiment exploits the open Science Grid to run a large number of monte carlo simulations.  Because the simulation code is highly complex and not practical to install at all sites, Parrot and the GROW filesystem are used to access the software on demand from Fermilab.
