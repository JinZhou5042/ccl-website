We're excited to share that the Cooperative Computing Lab website has been completely redesigned.
The new site puts our software, research, and news into a single, easier-to-browse home.

The biggest change is our blog. Instead of living at [cclnd.blogspot.com](https://cclnd.blogspot.com/), all posts are now part of the main site at [/blog](/blog/). The unified blog now brings all the powerful formatting from our Jekyll + al-folio stack—built‑in table of contents for longer articles, robust syntax‑highlighted code examples, and richer image and media support.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
<div class="col-sm-12">
{% include figure.liquid path="/assets/blog/2026/ccl-launches-redesigned-website/homepage.png" title="" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
</div>
</div>

Under the hood, we’ve moved away from our old WordPress setup to a static site on GitHub Pages, built on top of a heavily customized [al-folio theme](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio). This makes the site faster, easier to maintain, and better aligned with how we develop and ship our open source tools.

We’ve also added a search bar that looks across both pages and blog posts, so you can quickly jump from a software page to a tutorial, paper, or news item.
