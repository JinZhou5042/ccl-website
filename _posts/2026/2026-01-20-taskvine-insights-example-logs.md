Understanding a distributed runtime is much easier when you can inspect what actually happened during execution. To help users quickly learn and explore TaskVine, we introduce the TaskVine Example Logs repository:

This repository contains curated execution logs from real TaskVine workloads, all were from in-production scientific workflows. The logs capture runtime behavior such as task scheduling, worker activity, data movement, and performance statistics. Users can study realistic executions without setting up clusters or running large experiments themselves.

The logs are designed to be used together with TaskVine’s analysis and visualization tools. In particular, the TaskVine Report Tool can directly consume these logs and generate timelines, throughput plots, and performance breakdowns, making it easy to understand where time is spent and how a workflow executes in practice, please check this repository for more instructions:

If you are new to TaskVine, the official manual explains how logs are produced and how they reflect the runtime’s execution model:

This repository is part of the broader CCTools ecosystem, where you can find the entire TaskVine codebase:

If you have questions, run into issues, or want to discuss TaskVine behavior, please use GitHub Discussions, which is our official support channel. The team actively monitors the forum and typically responds quickly:

We hope these example logs make it easier to understand TaskVine, explore its runtime behavior, and turn execution data into useful insights.
