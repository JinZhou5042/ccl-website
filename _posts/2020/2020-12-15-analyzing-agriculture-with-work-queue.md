   at the University of Arizona is a massive robot that uses sensors, cameras, and GPS devices to collect vast quantities of agricultural data from crop fields.  In the background, distributed computing and deep learning techniques are used to understand and improve agricultural efficiencies in hot, dry, climates.  Processing all this data requires reliable computation on large clusters: the
