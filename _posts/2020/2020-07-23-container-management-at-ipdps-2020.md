CCL grad student Tim Shaffer recently presented his recent work on container management at IPDPS 2020:
  <span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">
   Container technologies are seeing wider use at
 advanced computing facilities for managing highly complex
 applications that must execute at multiple sites. However, in a
 distributed high throughput computing setting, the unrestricted 
use of containers can result in the container explosion problem.
  If a new container image is generated for each variation of a
 job dispatched to a site, shared storage is soon exceeded. On
 the other hand, if a single large container image is used to meet
 multiple needs, the size of that container may become a problem
 for storage and transport. To address this problem, we observe
 that many containers have an internal structure generated by
 a structured package manager, and this information could be
 used to strategically combine and share container images. We
 develop LANDLORD to exploit this property and evaluate its
 performance through a combination of simulation studies and
empirical measurement of high energy physics applications.
