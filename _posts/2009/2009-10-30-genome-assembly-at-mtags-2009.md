Christopher Moretti and Michael Olson will present their most recent work on

<a href="http://www.cse.nd.edu/~ccl/research/papers/assembly-mtags09.pdf">Scalable Genome Assembly</a>

at the

<a href="http://dsl.cs.uchicago.edu/MTAGS09/">MTAGS Workshop</a>

held at

<a href="http://www.sc09.org">Supercomputing 2009</a>

.

<br/>

<p>Their (unnamed) scalable assembler allows the end user to plug in a variety of custom algorithms for the computationally intensive phase of sequence alignment, using the <a href="http://www.cse.nd.edu/~ccl/software/workqueue">Work Queue</a> software to manage a workforce of hundreds of computers harnessed via <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor">Condor</a>.<br/></p>

<p>Our largest run so far used over 1000 nodes at three different institutions, reducing the time to perform alignments from over nine days to less than one hour.<br/><br/></p>
