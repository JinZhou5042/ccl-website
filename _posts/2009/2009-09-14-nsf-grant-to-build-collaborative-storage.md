  We have received a Collaborative Research Infrastructure grant from the National Science Foundation to build a wide area testbed for data intensive computing.  The
  <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0855047">
   Distributed Research Testbed
  </a>
  will establish interconnected computing nodes at the Universities of Chicago, Florida, Hawaii, Notre Dame, and Mississippi.  This testbed will provide an infrastructure for creating and evaluating new mechanisms for cloud and grid computing.
