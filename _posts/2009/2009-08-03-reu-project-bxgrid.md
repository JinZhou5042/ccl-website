This post continues last week's subject of summer REU projects.

<br/>

<br/>

Rachel Witty and Kameron Srimoungchanh worked on

<a href="http://dthain.blogspot.com/2008/12/bxgrid-biometrics-research-grid.html">BXGrid</a>

, our web portal and computing system for biometrics research. This project is a collaboration between the

<a href="http://www.cse.nd.edu/%7Eccl">Cooperative Computing Lab</a>

and the

<a href="http://www.cse.nd.edu/%7Ecvrl">Computer Vision Research Lab</a>

at Notre Dame. Hoang Bui is the lead graduate student on the project.  Rachel and Kameron added a bunch of new capabilities to the system; I'll show three examples today.

<p><div><br/>The first is the ability to handle 3-D face scans taken by a specialized camera equipped with a laser rangefinder. The still picture here doesn't quite do it justice, because each white "mask" on the left is a rotating animation of the face. By integrating this data into BXGrid, the 3-D data can be validated against previous ordinary images of the face.</div><div> </div></p>
