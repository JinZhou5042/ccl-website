<p>New features in this release include:<br/></p>

<dir><br/><li> Support for accessing the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) within Parrot.  This allows you to submit arbitrary Unix jobs to your cluster, cloud, or grid, and allow them to call home and access your HDFS installation.  No special privileges or kernel support is needed at the execution site.<br/></li><li> A number of new flags and features in Makeflow and Work Queue, which increase scalability and reliability for large workloads.<br/></li><li> An improved configuration and build system which should be portable across a wider array of platforms, with more precise linking capabilities.<br/></li></dir>

Thanks to Peter Bui, Christopher Moretti, Li Yu, and Michael Albrecht, who contributed to this release.
