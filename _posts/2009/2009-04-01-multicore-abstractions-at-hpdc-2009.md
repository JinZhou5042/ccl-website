A paper by Li Yu and Christopher Moretti on our newest developments in distributed computing with abstractions has been accepted to HPDC 2009 in Munich.

   Harnessing Parallelism in Multicore Clusters with the All-Pairs and Wavefront Abstractions
  </a>
  describes how to extend two abstractions to distributed systems that consist of multicore computers.  With our collaborators Dr. Scott Emrich at Notre Dame and Dr. Kenneth Judd at Stanford, we demonstrate applications of the Wavefront abstraction to problems in bioinformatics and genomics.
