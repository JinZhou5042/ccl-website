  Recent graduate Michael Lammie presented his work on managing energy in multicore clusters at the IEEE Grid conference in Banff, Canada.  His paper titled
  <a href="http://www.cse.nd.edu/~ccl/research/pubs/multicore-grid09.pdf">
   Scheduling Grid Workloads on Multicore Clusters to Minimize Energy and Maximize Performance
  </a>
  , describes how to reduce the energy consumed by a large multicore cluster through the careful application of node scaling, voltage scaling, and job assignment.  This work was done in collabration with Paul Brenner in the Notre Dame Center for Research Computing.
