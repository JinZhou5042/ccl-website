  Presented by Li Yu and Peter Bui

  <p>
   Makeflow and Work Queue are frameworks that make it easy to construct applications that can scale up from a single CPU to hundreds or thousands of cores.  These fault tolerant frameworks allow you to harness idle computers around your lab as well as large scale computing clusters.  At Notre Dame, they have been used to solve large problems in biometrics, data mining, economics, genomics, and can be applied to many other fields.

  <p>
   This class will consist of one half lecture and one half hands-on tutorial with Makeflow and Work Queue.  After completing the class, students will be able to write simple applications that run on tens to hundreds of cores.  Comfort with the Linux command-line interface is required.
