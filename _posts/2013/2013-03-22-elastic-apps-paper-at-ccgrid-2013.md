  Dinesh Rajan will present his paper
  <br/>
  <a href="http://www.nd.edu/~ccl/research/papers/casestudies-ccgrid13.pdf">
   Case Studies in Designing Elastic Applications
  </a>
  at the IEEE International Conference on Clusters, Clouds, and Grids (CCGrid) in Delft, the Netherlands.  This work was done in collaboration with Andrew Thrasher and Scott Emrich from the
  <a href="http://www.nd.edu/~biocmp">
   Notre Dame Bioinformatics Lab
  </a>
  , and Badi Abdul-Wahid and Jesus Izaguirre from the
  <a href="http://www.nd.edu/~lcls">
   Laboratory for Computational Life Sciences
  </a>
  .
  <br/>
  <p>
   The paper describes our experience in designing three different elastic applications --  E-MAKER, Elastic Replica Exchange, and Folding at Work -- that run on hundreds to thousands of cores using the
   <a href="http://www.nd.edu/~ccl/software/workqueue">
    Work Queue
   </a>
   framework.  The paper offers six guidelines for designing similar applications:
  </p>
  <ol>
   <br/>
   <li>
    Abolish shared writes.
    <br/>
   </li>
   <li>
    Keep your software close and your dependencies closer.
    <br/>
   </li>
   <li>
    Synchronize two, you make company; synchronize
    <br/>
    three, you make a crowd.
    <br/>
   </li>
   <li>
    Make tasks of a feather flock together.
    <br/>
   </li>
   <li>
    Seek simplicity, and gain power.
    <br/>
   </li>
   <li>
    Build a model before scaling new heights.
    <br/>
   </li>
  </ol>
