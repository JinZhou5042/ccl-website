The

<a href="http://ccl.cse.nd.edul/workshop/2013">Annual CCL Workshop</a>

was held on October 10-11 at the University of Notre Dame.  The CCL 
team ran beginning and advanced tutorials and gave highlights of the 
many new features
and capabilities in the software.  Community members spoke about the 
many
ways in which Makeflow, Work Queue, Parrot, and Chirp are used to 
acclerate
discoveries in fields such as bioinformatics, high energy physics, 
weather prediction, image analysis, and molecular dynamics.  Everyone 
got together
to share a meal, solve problems, and generate new ideas.
Thanks to everyone who participated, and see you
