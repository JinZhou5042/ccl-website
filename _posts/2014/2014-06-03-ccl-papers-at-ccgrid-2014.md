Three papers from the CCL were presented at the 2014 IEEE Conference on Cluster, Cloud, and Grid Computing in Chicago:

<br/>

<ul>
<li> Paul Brenner presented a regular paper, <br/><a href="http://www.nd.edu/~ccl/research/papers/oppo-ccgrid14.pdf">Opportunistic High Energy Physics Computing in User Space with Parrot</a> which shows how we use Parrot to provide transparent access to complex software stacks without requiring a dedicated shared file system.</li>
<li> Olivia Choudhury presented <a href="http://www.nd.edu/~ccl/research/papers/bio-partition-c4bio-grid14.pdf">Accelerating Comparative Genomics Workflows in a Distributed Environment with Optimized Data Partitioning</a> at the C4Bio Workshop.  This paper explores various strategies for data partitioning in bioinformatics applications; showing that partitioning for parallel execution must be specialized to the objective of the underlying tool.</li>
<li> Nick Hazekamp presented a poster, <a href="http://www.nd.edu/~ccl/research/papers/workflow-expand-grid14.pdf">Expanding Tasks of Logical Workflows into Independent Workflows for Improved Scalability</a> in which he demonstrated a technique for transparently parallelizing components of a Galaxy workflow using Makeflow.</li>
</ul>
