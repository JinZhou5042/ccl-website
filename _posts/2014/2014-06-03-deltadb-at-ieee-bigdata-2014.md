  Peter Ivie will be presenting his work on the
  <a href="http://www.nd.edu/~ccl/research/papers/pivie-deltadb-2014.pdf">
   DeltaDB database model
  </a>
  for time-varying schema-free data at the IEEE International Congress on Big Data in Anchorage. The DeltaDB concept is what underlies the query engine for the cctools catalog server.
