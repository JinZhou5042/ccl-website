Ben Tovar gave a talk introducing the VC3 (

<a href="http://www.virtualclusters.org/" target="_blank">Virtual Clusters for Community Computation</a>

) project at the annual

<a href="https://agenda.hep.wisc.edu/event/1201/" target="_blank">HTCondor Wee</a>

k conference.

<br/>

<br/>

VC3 makes it easy for science groups to deploy custom software stacks across existing university clusters and national facilities.  For example, if you want to run your own private Condor pool across three clusters and share it with your collaborators, then VC3 is for you.

<br/>

<br/>

We are now running VC3 as a "limited beta" for early adopters who would like to give it a try and send us feedback.  Check out the

<a href="https://docs.virtualclusters.org/" target="_blank">instructions and invitation</a>

to sign up.
