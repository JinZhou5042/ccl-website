Nick Hazekamp and Kyle Sweeney gave a talk, "Distributed Computing with Makeflow and Work Queue", at the CyVerse Container Camp workshop.  
This talk gives an overview of Makeflow and Work Queue, with an emphasis on how we approach using containers in a workflow.
Highlights of the talk focused on different approaches to applying containers, either per-task or workflow-level, 
and what that looks like in practice on Jetstream, an Openstack based cloud platform.
