Prof. Thain gave a talk titled Analyzing LHC Data on 10K Cores with Lobster at the
<a href="http://datasys.cs.iit.edu/events/DataCloud2015/">
Workshop on Data Intensive Computing in the Clouds
</a>
at Supercomputing 2015.  The talk gave an overview of our collaboration with members of the CMS experiment at Notre Dame.  Together, we have built a data analysis system which can deploy the complex CMS computing environment on large clusters of non-dedicated machines.
