  Dr. Peter Sempolinski successfully defended his PhD thesis titled "An Extensible System for Facilitating Collaboration for Structural Engineering Applications"

While at Notre Dame, Peter created a
  <a href="http://windtunnel.crc.nd.edu/">
   Virtual Wind Tunnel
  </a>
  which enabled the crowdsourcing of structural design and evaluation by combining online building design with Google Sketchup and CFD simulation with OpenFoam.  The system was used in a variety of contexts, ranging from virtual engineering classes to managing work crowdsourced via Mechanical Turk. his work was recently accepted for publication in IEEE CiSE and PLOS1.

Congratulations to Dr. Sempolinski!
