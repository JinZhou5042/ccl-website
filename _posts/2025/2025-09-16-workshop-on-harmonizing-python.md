<p>This workshop is one component of our NSF POSE project to explore the creation of an open source ecosystem encompassing a variety of workflow technologies, including the Parsl Project (Kyle Chard at the University of Chicago), the RADICAL tools (Shantenu Jha, Rutgers University), and TaskVine (Douglas Thain, University of Notre Dame).</p>

<p>Workshop attendees conducted several working groups where they identified key barriers to workflow creation, deployment, and adoption; proposed activities for an open source ecosystem to support these needs; and provided feedback on the possible structure sof an ecosystem.</p>

<p>The organizers will be following up soon with a workshop report and draft proposal for next steps.</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone who participated!</p>
