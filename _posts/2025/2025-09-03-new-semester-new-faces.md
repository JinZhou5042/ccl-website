<p>The new semester is here, and we’re excited to welcome three new colleagues and roll out a clear plan for the months ahead.</p>

<p><strong>New faces.</strong> Lax joins as a first-year Ph.D. student. Ryan just completed his M.S. in our lab and begins his Ph.D. this semester. Abby joins as a first-year M.S. student. We’re glad to have them on board!</p>

<p>Each semester we adjust our routines and schedules to keep the lab running smoothly and to support a diverse team. This semester we’re trying a few new approaches. Colin will organize our weekly team talks with a schedule planned about a month ahead, host practice sessions for conference presentations, and invite remote guests for ~30-minute Zoom talks and discussion. Jin will handle outreach and support: a short blog every Tuesday, cross-posting to LinkedIn and other channels, encouraging GitHub Discussions as a support path, and serving as the first responder for incoming technical questions. Saiful will lead the website migration to a Jekyll site on GitHub, move over most existing content, convert prior posts into native Jekyll, and switch our papers database from PHP + database to a JSON dataset. Ben, the most experienced and supportive engineer who knows every line of the codebase, will guide release engineering: review PRs and give feedback, prioritize and maintain issues, keep integration tests in working order, and plan and ship regular software releases.</p>

Ground rules: you are responsible for your output; do not create extra work for others; use ND-authorized tools such as Gemini and Gemini-CLI to protect data. This week each person will pick a modest task and tool to explore. Next week we will report on methods, results, and observations.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></p>

<p><strong>Project highlights.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>CMS Computing</strong> (Barry, Jin, Ben, Alan): keep the current TaskVine release stable and usable; share successes with the HEP community; publish the new <em>cms-taskvine-example</em> repository; advance an IPDPS/TPDS paper on dynamic data reduction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>NSF CSSI Floability</strong> (Saiful, Abby, Ben): keep the release stable, usable, and documented; attach straightforward data handling for existing applications; grow users and collaborations; build interactive visualization of notebook workflows to support troubleshooting and performance; then extend the approach to new notebook and workflow models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>NSF Consistency Contracts</strong> (Colin + Jin): complete and release the basic toolchain to measure, summarize, and enforce; choose baseline techniques that exploit application behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DOE XGFabric</strong> (Ryan, Thanh): capture the full software stack; port to multiple ACCESS sites and troubleshoot issues as they appear; evaluate scale, responsiveness, and resource use; develop solutions for HPC batch queue delays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>NSF HARMONY</strong>: run a fall workshop on workflow collaboration with the eScience conference; capture examples across Parsl-TaskVine (astro), DaskVine (HEP), and RADICAL (xgfabric).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>NASA-SADE</strong> (Lucas, Lax): demonstrate the simulation infrastructure at the September Year 2 review; evaluate OS scalability and performance; begin integrating native SADE components.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll post a short update every Tuesday and syndicate it to LinkedIn and other channels. Questions and ideas are welcome on GitHub Discussions.</p>
