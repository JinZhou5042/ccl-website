Haiyan Meng will present a paper titled

<i><b><a href="http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/research/papers/workflow-reproducibility-iccs2017.pdf">Facilitating the Reproducibility of Scientific Workflows with Execution Environment Specifications</a> </b></i>

at

<a href="http://www.iccs-meeting.org/iccs2017/">the International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS) 2017</a>

this June at Zurich, Switzerland. This paper explores the challenges in reproducing scientific workflows, and proposes a framework for facilitating the reproducibility of scientific workflows at the task level by giving scientists complete control over the execution environments of the tasks in their workflows and integrating execution environment specifications into scientific workflow systems.
