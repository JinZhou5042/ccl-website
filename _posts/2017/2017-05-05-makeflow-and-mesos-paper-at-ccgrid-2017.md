<html><body>Charles Zheng will present the paper <a href="http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/research/papers/makeflow-mesos-ccgrid17.pdf"><b><i>Deploying High Throughput Scientific Workflows on Container Schedulers with Makeflow and Mesos</i></b></a> at the <a href="https://www.arcos.inf.uc3m.es/ccgrid2017/">17th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGrid 2017)</a> in May 15, 2017 at Madrid, Spain. In this paper we consider how to launch workflow system on container schedulers with minimal performance loss and higher system efficiency. As examples of current technology, we use Makeflow,  Work Queue, Resource Monitor and Mesos. We observe that using Work Queue and Resource Monitor not only reduces the task turnaround time but also achieves higher resource usage rate. Following is the system architecture.<br/>
