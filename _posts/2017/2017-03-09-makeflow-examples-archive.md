  We recently updated our archive of example Makeflows so that they are significantly easier to download, execute, and reshape to various sizes.   For each one, we have instructions on how to obtain the underlying binary program, generate some sample data, and then create a workload of arbitrary size.  This allows you to experiment with Makeflow at small scale, and then dial things up when you are ready run on on thousands of nodes:
