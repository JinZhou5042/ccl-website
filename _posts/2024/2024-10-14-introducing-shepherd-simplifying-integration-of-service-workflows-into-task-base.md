<p>We are pleased to announce the release of <strong><a href="https://github.com/cooperative-computing-lab/shepherd" target="_blank">Shepherd</a></strong>, an open-source tool designed to streamline the integration of service workflows into task-based workflows. Shepherd enables users to manage applications that require dynamic dependencies and state monitoring, ensuring that each component in a workflow starts only after its dependencies have reached specified states.</p>
