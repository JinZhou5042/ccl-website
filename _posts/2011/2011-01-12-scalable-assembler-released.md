  We are pleased to announce the release of version 3.2.0 of SAND -- the Scalable Assembler at Notre Dame.
  <br/>
  <p>
   SAND replaces the early stages of the Celera Assembler with scalable versions that can run on collections of commodity computers.  By harnessing clusters, clouds, grids, or just random machines in your office, many bioinformatics tasks can be accelerated many times over.  SAND is an open source project, and we invite the community to use and improve the software.

  <p>
   This release features the following improvements:
  </p>
  <dir>
   <br/>
   <li>
    Improved integration with Celera 5.4; simply use the provided sand_runCA script to start the workflow.
    <br/>
   </li>
   <li>
    A significant performance increase in both the filtering and alignment stages.
    <br/>
   </li>
