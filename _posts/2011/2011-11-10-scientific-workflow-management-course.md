  Michael Albrecht will be teaching
  <a href="http://nd.edu/~malbrec2/courses/workflows_sp12/">
   CSE 60145: Scientific Workflow Management
  </a>
  in the spring of 2012.
  <br/>
  <p>
   The goal of this course is to cover the tools and techniques necessary to manage large-scale scientific workflows, with an emphasis on the systems available for use at Notre Dame through the Cooperative Computing Lab and the Center for Research Computing. Students will be introduced to the difficulties involved in managing large datasets and complex workflows, as well as the methods frequently used to ameliorate them. This course is designed for graduate students from any college or discipline who deal with large and/or complex workflows (we currently work with fields ranging from computer vision to molecular biology to economics).
