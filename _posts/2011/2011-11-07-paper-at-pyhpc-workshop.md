Peter Bui will be presenting

<a href="http://www.cse.nd.edu/~ccl/research/papers/wq-python-pyhpc2011.pdf">Work Queue + Python: A Framework For Scalable Scientific Ensemble Applications</a>

at the

<a href="http://www.dlr.de/sc/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-1183/1638_read-31733/">Workshop on Python for High Performance and Scientific Computing</a>

at Supercomputing 2011.

<br/>

<p>This paper describes how we have combined Python with the <a href="http://www.nd.edu/~ccl/software/workqueue">Work Queue</a> framework to construct several scalable applications in collaboration with the <a href="http://www.nd.edu/~lcls">Laboratory for Computational Life Sciences</a> at Notre Dame.  The software described here is also incorporated into the <a href="http://www.nd.edu/~ccl/news.php?id=67">latest release</a> of the CCTools software.<br/></p>
