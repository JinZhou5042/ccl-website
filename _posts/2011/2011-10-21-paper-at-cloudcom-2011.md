Dinesh Pandiar wrote a paper titled

<a href="http://cse.nd.edu/~ccl/research/papers/elasticreplex_cloudcom11.pdf">Converting A High Performance Application to an Elastic Cloud Application</a>

, which was accepted to the IEEE CloudCom conference, which will be in Greece in November 2011.

<br/>

<p>This paper describes some of our recent work in converting traditional high-performance message passing (MPI) applications into a more flexible form for cloud computing.  MPI is great on dedicated clusters, but isn't designed to handle failures or wide performance variations.  By recasting this molecular dynamics application into our <a href="http://www.nd.edu/~ccl/software/workqueue">Work Queue</a> framework, we are able to break out of traditional clusters and run codes on hundreds of cores spanning our local Condor pool, and cloud service providers such as EC2 and Azure.<br/></p>

<p>This work was started by Anthony Canino, one of our REU students from summer 2010, and done in close collaboration with Badi Abdul-Wahid and Jesus Izaguirre, who are experts in the field of molecular dynamics.  Another graduate student from the CCL, Li Yu, will travel to present the paper on their behalf.<br/><br/></p>
