Patrick Donnelly successfully defended his Ph.D. titled "Data Locality Techniques in an Active Cluster Filesystem for Scientific Workflows". 

Congratulations to Dr. Donnelly!

   The
 continued exponential growth of storage capacity has catalyzed the 
broad acquisition of scientific data which must be processed. While 
today's large data analysis systems are highly effective at establishing
 data locality and eliminating inter-dependencies, they are not so 
easily incorporated into scientific workflows that are often complex and
 irregular graphs of sequential programs with multiple dependencies. To 
address the needs of scientific computing, I propose the design of an 
active storage cluster file system which allows for execution of regular
 unmodified applications with full data
   <br/>
   locality.

This 
dissertation analyzes the potential benefits of exploiting the 
structural information already available in scientific workflows -- the 
explicit dependencies -- to achieve a scalable and stable system. I 
begin with an outline of the design of the Confuga active storage 
cluster file system and its applicability to scientific computing. The 
remainder of the dissertation examines the techniques used to achieve a 
scalable and stable system. First, file system access by jobs is scoped 
to explicitly defined dependencies resolved at job dispatch. Second, 
workflow's structural information is harnessed to direct and control 
necessary file transfers to enforce cluster stability and maintain 
performance. Third, control of transfers is selectively relaxed to 
improve performance by limiting any negative effects of centralized 
transfer management.

This work benefits users by providing a 
complete batch execution platform joined with a cluster file system. The
 user does not need to redesign their workflow or provide additional 
consideration to the management of data dependencies. System stability 
and performance is managed by the cluster file
   <br/>
   system while 
providing jobs with complete data locality. - See more at:
