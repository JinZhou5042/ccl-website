   "At
   <a href="http://spu.edu/">
    Seattle Pacific University
   </a>
   we have used
   <a href="http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/workqueue">
    Work Queue
   </a>
   in the CSC/CPE 4760 
Advanced Computer Architecture course in Spring 2014 and Spring 2016.  
Work Queue serves
 as our primary example of a distributed system in our “Distributed and 
Cloud Computing” unit for the course.  Work Queue was chosen because it 
is easy to deploy, and undergraduate students can quickly get started 
working on projects that harness the power
 of distributed resources."

The main project in this unit had the 
students obtain benchmark results for three systems: a high performance workstation; a cluster of 12 Raspberry Pi 2 boards, and a cluster of A1 instances in 
Microsoft Azure.  The task for each benchmark
 used Dr. Peter Bui’s Work Queue MapReduce framework; the students 
tested both a Word Count and Inverted Index on the Linux
 kernel source. In testing the three systems the students were exposed to 
the principles of distributed computing and the MapReduce model as they investigated tradeoffs in price, performance, and overhead.
