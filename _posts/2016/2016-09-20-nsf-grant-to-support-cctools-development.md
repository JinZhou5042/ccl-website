We are pleased to announce that our work will continue to be supported by the National Science Foundation through the division of Advanced Cyber Infrastructure.

<i>The project is titled "<span class="pageheadsubline"></span><span class="pageheadline"><span class="pageheadline"><a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1642409&amp;HistoricalAwards=false">SI2-SSE: Scaling up Science on Cyberinfrastructure with the Cooperative Computing Tools</a>"  It</span></span>
 will advance the development of the <a href="http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software">Cooperative Computing Tool</a><a href="https://www.blogger.com/null">s</a> to meet the 
changing technology landscape in three key respects: exploiting 
container technologies, making efficient use of local concurrency, and 
performing capacity management at the workflow scale.  We will continue to focus on active user 
communities in high energy physics, which rely on Parrot for global 
scale filesystem access in campus clusters and the Open Science Grid; 
bioinformatics users executing complex workflows via the VectorBase, 
LifeMapper, and CyVerse disciplinary portals, and ensemble molecular 
dynamics applications that harness GPUs from XSEDE and commercial 
clouds. </i>
