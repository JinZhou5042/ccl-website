   Data Intensive Scientific Computing
  </a>
  at the University of Notre Dame.  Ten undergraduate students came to ND from around the country and worked on projects encompassing physics, astronomy, bioinformatics, network sciences, molecular dynamics, and data visualization with faculty at Notre Dame.
