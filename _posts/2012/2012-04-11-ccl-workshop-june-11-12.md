The first annual CCL workshop will be held June 11-12th, 2012 on the campus of the University of Notre Dame. The theme of this year's workshop is "Scalable Software for Scientific Computing".

<br/>

<br/>

This workshop is an opportunity to learn more about scalable software from the CCL and other related projects, see how others are applying it to advance their research, and to provide some input into the direction of our research and software development. The workshop will be of interest to both students and faculty involved in either the scientific objectives or the software tools of scalable science.

<br/>

<br/>

An initial list of speakers is available, but we also invite proposals for research talks (20 minutes) or short reports (5 minutes) highlighting recent accomplishments.

<br/>
