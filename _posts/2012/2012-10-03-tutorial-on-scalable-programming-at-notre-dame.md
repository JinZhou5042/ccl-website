   Would you like to learn how to write programs that can scale up to
   <br/>
   hundreds or thousands of machines?
  </p>
  <p>
   This tutorial will provide an introduction to writing scalable
   <br/>
   programs using Makeflow and Work Queue.  These tools are used at Notre
   <br/>
   Dame and around the world to attack large problems in fields such as
   <br/>
   biology, chemistry, data mining, economics, physics, and more.  Using
   <br/>
   these tools, you will be able to write programs that can scale up to
   <br/>
   hundreds or thousands of machines drawn from clusters, clouds, and
   <br/>
   grids.
  </p>
  <p>
   This tutorial is appropriate for new graduate students, undergraduate
   <br/>
   researchers, and research staff involved in computing in any
   <br/>
   department on campus.  Some familiarity with Unix and the ability to
   <br/>
   program in Python, Perl, or C is required.
  </p>
  <p>
   The class will consist of half lecture and half hands-on instruction
   <br/>
   in a computer equipped classroom.  The instructors are Dinesh Rajan
   <br/>
   and Michael Albrecht, developers of the software who are PhD students
   <br/>
   in the CSE department.
