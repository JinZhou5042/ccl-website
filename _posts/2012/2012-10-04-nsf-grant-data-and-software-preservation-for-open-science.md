  Mike Hildreth, Professor of Physics, Jarek Nabrzyski, Director of the Center for Research Computing and Concurrent Associate Professor of Computer Science and Engineering, and Douglas Thain, Associate Professor of Computer Science and Engineering, are the lead investigators on a project that will explore solutions to the problems of preserving data, analysis software, and how these relate to results obtained from the analysis of large datasets.
  <br/>
  <p>
   Known as Data and Software Preservation for Open Science (DASPOS), it is focused on High Energy Physics data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Fermilab Tevatron. The group will also survey and incorporate the preservation needs of other communities, such as Astrophysics and Bioinformatics, where large datasets and the derived results are becoming the core of emerging science in these disciplines
  </p>
  <p>
   The three-year $1.8M program, funded by the National Science Foundation, will include several international workshops and the design of a prototype data and software-preservation architecture that meets the functionality needed by the scientific disciplines. What is learned from building this prototype will inform the design and construction of the global data and software-preservation infrastructure for the LHC, and potentially for other disciplines.
  </p>
  <p>
   The multi-disciplinary DASPOS team includes particle physicists, computer scientists, and digital librarians from Notre Dame, the University of Chicago, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, New York University, and the University of Washington, Seattle.
