The

<a href="https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/display/ACIC">Applied Cyber Infrastructure Concepts</a>

course at the University of Arizona makes use of the

<a href="http://www.nd.edu/%7Eccl/software">Cooperative Computing Tools</a>

to teach
principles of large scale distributed computing.  The project-based 
course introduced fundamental concepts and tools for analyzing large 
datasets on national computing resources and commercial cloud providers.
  For the final project, students developed an appliance for annotating 
multiple rice genomes using

<a href="http://www.yandell-lab.org/software/maker.html">MAKER </a>

software, distributed across Amazon and FutureGrid resources via the

<a href="http://www.nd.edu/%7Eccl/software/workqueue">Work Queue</a>

framework. They also developed a web application to visualize the 
performance and utilization of each cloud appliance in real-time, 
overall progress of the rice annotation process, and integrated the 
final results into a genome browser.
