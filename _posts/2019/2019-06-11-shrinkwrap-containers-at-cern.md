Tim Shaffer attended the
  <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/757415/">
   2019 CVMFS Workshop
  </a>
  and presented "
  <a href="http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/research/talks/shrinkwrap-cvmfs-2019.pdf">
   Shrinkwrap: Creating HPC Containers
  </a>
  ", work done together with Nick Hazekamp.  Shrinkwrap is a tool that profiles applications using the
  <a href="http://cvmfs.cern.ch/">
   CVMFS filesystem
  </a>
  and generates a minimal container image with only the parts of the global filesystem that were actually used:

   </div>

  Since the LHC is currently shut down between runs, attendees were able to tour  the experiment hall and see the CMS detector up close!
