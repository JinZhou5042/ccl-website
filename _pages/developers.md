The CCTools software is primarily developed by a team at the University of Notre Dame led by Prof. Douglas Thain and Dr. Ben Tovar, with many substantial contributions from graduate students, undergraduate researchers, and outside contributions. We welcome external contributions! For minor bug or documentation fixes, you are very welcome to propose a modification via [pull request](https://github.com/cooperative-computing-lab/cctools/pulls). If you are contemplating a major change, please[create a new issue](https://github.com/cooperative-computing-lab/cctools/issues) to discuss the problem and your ideas, and we can work together to share the solution prior to coding.

## Quick Start for Developers

See the [Build From Source](https://github.com/cooperative-computing-lab/cctools?tab=readme-ov-file#build-from-source) instructions in cctools/README.md. We recommend checking out the code, then using Miniconda to deploy the development environment from `environment.yml`, then `make`. The development environment contains a number of code quality and analysis tools in addition to the standard production environment.
