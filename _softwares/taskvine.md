description: TaskVine is our third-generation workflow system for building scalable data intensive applications that run on HPC clusters, cloud services, and other clusters.
long_description: 'TaskVine is a task scheduler for building large scale data intensive dynamic workflows that run on HPC clusters, GPU clusters, and commercial clouds. As tasks access external data sources and produce their own outputs, more and more data is pulled into local storage on workers. This data is used to accelerate future tasks and avoid re-computing exisiting results. Data gradually grows "like a vine" through the cluster. TaskVine is our third-generation workflow system, built on our twenty years of experience creating scalable applications in fields such as high energy physics, bioinformatics, molecular dynamics, and machine learning.'
