long_description: "The Floability Project is an NSF funded research project to enable the rapid and portable deployment of notebooks expressing complex scientific workflows across a wide range of cyberinfrastructure. The key technical challenge is that workflows are incomplete: the code by itself cannot be moved between facilities without accurately capturing the software dependencies, required datasets, and capabilities of the underlying cluster hardware. Our research team at the University of Notre Dame, the University of Missouri-Columbia, and the University of Illinois is developing solutions to discover, express, and deploy the complete set of dependencies needed for complex scientific workflows."
