The JX Expression Language is an extension of the JSON data description language. It combines familiar expression operators, function calls, external data, and ordinary JSON contents to yield a powerful data querying and manipulation language. JX is used throughout the CCTools to manage and query unstructured data.

For example, JX expressions can be used to describe jobs in a workflow:

```
{
    "command" : "collect.exe"
    "inputs" :  [ "input."+i+".txt" ]
    "outputs" : [ "output."+i+".txt" ]
} for i in range(1,100)
```

Or to write LINQ-style queries on remote data:
```
fetch(url).select(type=="wq_master").select(tasks_submitted>100).project([name,tasks_running+tasks_waiting])
```
