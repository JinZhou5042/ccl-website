title: "SADE: A Safety-Aware Ecosystem of Reputable sUAS"
subtitle: "PI: Jane Cleland-Huang (U Notre Dame)"
description: The overall goal of the project is to develop technology for safety zones that permit only trusted drones to operate in congested or sensitive airspace.
long_description: "The SADE project is a large collaborative undertaking across the University of Notre Dame, Iowa State University, St Louis University, University of Texas El Paso, and DePaul University. The overall goal of the project is to develop technology for safety zones that permit only trusted drones to operate in congested or sensitive airspace. The CCL is contributing to this project with the development of complex simulation infrastructure that will allow for in-silico testing of drone control software. This infrastructure includes flight controllers (PX4), physical simulators (Gazebo) gaming technology (Unreal), and other services all dynamically deployed in HPC infrastructure. This allows developers of drone control software to evaluate the correctness of systems at scale before deploying to real-world scenarios."
