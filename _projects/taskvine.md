title: "TaskVine: A User Level Framework for Data Intensive Scientific Applications (CSSI Element)"
subtitle: "PI: Douglas Thain"
description: "TaskVine is open source software for building large scale data intensive dynamic workflows that run on HPC clusters, GPU clusters, and commercial clouds. "
long_description: "TaskVine is open source software for building large scale data intensive dynamic workflows that run on HPC clusters, GPU clusters, and commercial clouds. As tasks access external data sources and produce their own outputs, more and more data is pulled into local storage on workers. This data is used to accelerate future tasks and avoid re-computing exisiting results. Data gradually grows \"like a vine\" through the cluster. By using a variety of pioneering techniques such as distant futures, distributed provenance, and graph pruning, TaskVine is able to outperform traditional distributed computing techniques. It has been used to build large scale applications in scientific fields such as high energy physics, bioinformatics, molecular dynamics, and machine learning. We continue to develop new techniques within TaskVine, and extend it use to new applications."
