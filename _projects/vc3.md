title: "Completed Project: VC3: Virtual Clusters for Community Computation (2016-2019)"
subtitle: "PIs: Douglas Thain, Robert Gardner, and John Hover"
description: "VC3 made it possible for researchers to easily aggregate and share resources, install custom software environments, and deploy clustering frameworks across multiple HPC facilities through the concept of “virtual clusters”."
long_description: "A traditional HPC computing facility provides a large amount of computing power but has a fixed environment designed to satisfy local needs. This makes it very challenging for users to deploy complex applications that span multiple sites and require specific application software, scheduling middleware, or sharing policies. This project addressed many of these challenges by making it possible for researchers to easily aggregate and share resources, install custom software environments, and deploy clustering frameworks across multiple HPC facilities through the concept of “virtual clusters”. We designed and implemented a prototype virtual cluster facility that enabled unprivileged users to create dynamic aggregations of computing power across multiple sites, deployed with custom middleware and complex software dependencies. This service is hosted at the University of Chicago and available through the site virtualclusters.org."
