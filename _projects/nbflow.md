title: "NBFlow: From Notebook to Workflow and Back Again (CSSI Framework)"
subtitle: "PIs: Douglas Thain, Kevin Lannon, Tanu Malik (De Paul U), and Shaowen Wang (U Illinois)"
description: "NBFlow brings together interactive notebook technologies (Jupyter), reproducibility tools (SciUnit), and distributed workflows (TaskVine) to enable easy execution of large-scale notebook workflows on heterogeneous HPC clusters."
long_description: "NBFlow is our newest CSSI project that brings together interactive notebook technologies (Jupyter), with reproducibility tools (SciUnit), and distributed workflows (TaskVine). The combined result will be a new system (NBFlow) that makes it easy to execute large scale workflows on thousands of cluster nodes, through the familiar interface of the executable notebook. While easily stated, this presents a number of challenges to reconcile the high throughput but unpredictable nature of clusters with the immediate feedback expected by notebooks. We will develop a number of new techniques to convert notebooks into workflows, execute them reliably on the cluster, and then return them back again to the user. This project is a collaboration with Kevin Lannon (U Notre Dame), Tanu Malik (DePaul U), and Shaowen Wang (U Illinois)."
