title: "Scalable Data Analysis Applications for High Energy Physics"
subtitle: "PIs: Douglas Thain and Kevin Lannon"
description: Expresses workflow I/O intentions using consistency contracts to enable efficient, cluster-wide storage and execution optimizations.
long_description: "For more than 10 years, we have collaborated with Prof. Kevin Lannon and the CMS physics group at Notre Dame to design and build large scale data analysis applications that interpret data produced by the Compact Muon Solenoid detector at CERN. These applications are both interesting and challenging from a computer science perspective, because they must consume large quantities of data (Terabytes to Petabytes), scale up to thousands of nodes in clusters, and yet also remain reliable and responsive to the end user. Our latest work makes use of the TaskVine framework along with software such as Dask and Coffea as the foundation to create a variety of custom applications, including Lobster, TopEFT, DV4, RS-Triphoton, and more. We continue to innovate at the interface between computer science and physical science."

For more than 10 years, we have collaborated with Prof. Kevin Lannon and the CMS physics group at Notre Dame to design and build large scale data analysis applications that interpret data produced by the Compact Muon Solenoid detector at CERN. These applications are both interesting and challenging from a computer science perspective, because they must consume large quantities of data (Terabytes to Petabytes), scale up to thousands of nodes in clusters, and yet also remain reliable and responsive to the end user. Our latest work makes use of the [TaskVine](/softwares/taskvine) framework along with software such as Dask and Coffea as the foundation to create a variety of custom applications, including Lobster, TopEFT, DV4, RS-Triphoton, and more. We continue to innovate at the interface between computer science and physical science.
