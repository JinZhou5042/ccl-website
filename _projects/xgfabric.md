description: "This project will explore the design of systems for connecting remote wireless sensor networks with high performance computing systems."

long_description: "The SADE project is a large collaborative undertaking across the University of Notre Dame, Iowa State University, St Louis University, University of Texas El Paso, and DePaul University. The overall goal of the project is to develop technology for safety zones that permit only trusted drones to operate in congested or sensitive airspace. The CCL is contributing to this project with the development of complex simulation infrastructure that will allow for in-silico testing of drone control software. This infrastructure includes flight controllers (PX4), physical simulators (Gazebo) gaming technology (Unreal), and other services all dynamically deployed in HPC infrastructure. This allows developers of drone control software to evaluate the correctness of systems at scale before deploying to real-world scenarios."

XGFabric is one of several projects recently awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy for exploratory research in extreme scale science. This project will explore the design of systems for connecting remote wireless sensor networks with high performance computing systems. The driving applications are in digital agriculture, where extensive sensors are already used to observe weather, growing conditions, and the current state of crops. However, exploiting this data to improve agriculture in a timely way is challenging, due to energy and computing limitations of remote settings. Only a high performance computing (HPC) center has the capability to run the simulations needed to predict micro-weather and recommend interventions. This project will develop XGFabric, a novel software system that will allow complex workflows to span remote 5G/6G sensor networks, edge computers, and powerful HPC facilities, enabling timely access to powerful computing capabilities from remote agricultural sites.
